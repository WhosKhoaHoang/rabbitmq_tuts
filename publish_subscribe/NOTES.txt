. The "publish/subscribe" pattern involves delivering a message to multiple consumers.

. To illustrate the pattern, we've built a simple logging system. It consists of two programs -- the first emits log messages and the second receives and prints them.

. In our logging system every running copy of the receiver program gets the messages. That way we're able to run one receiver and direct the logs to disk; and at the same time we're be able to run another receiver and see the logs on the screen.

. Essentially, published log messages are going to be broadcast to all the receivers.
