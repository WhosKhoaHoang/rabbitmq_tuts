. For topic exchanges, binding keys become a little more specific. They are descriptive words separated by dots and offer the ability to generalize via a matching syntax (stars and hashes).


. Topic exchange is powerful and can behave like other exchanges. When a queue is bound with "#" (hash) binding key - it will receive all the messages, regardless of the routing key - like in fanout exchange. When special characters, "*" (star) and "#" (hash), aren't used in bindings, the topic exchange will behave just like a direct one.


. HOW TO DO QUICK TEST:
- Specify the binding keys that ReceivedLogsTopic expects (in run configs --> program arguments)
- Specify the binding keys that EmitLogTopic will send (in run configs --> program arguments)
- Run ReceivedLogsTopic
- Run EmitLogTopic
- A "Received" output will appear for ReceivedLogsTopic if a message was sent from EmitLogTopic with a matching binding key
