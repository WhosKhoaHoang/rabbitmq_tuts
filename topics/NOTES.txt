. For topic exchanges, binding keys become a little more specific. They are descriptive words separated by dots and offer the ability to generalize via a matching syntax (stars and hashes).

When special characters, "*" (star) and "#" (hash), aren't used in bindings, the topic exchange will behave just like a direct one.
